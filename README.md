## Installation and Setup
To use this repository effectively, you'll need to set up a SQL environment on your local machine. Here's a step-by-step guide to get you started:
1. **Choose a Database Management System (DBMS)**:
   - For beginners, SQLite is a lightweight option that doesn't require a separate server process.
   - For more advanced users, MySQL or PostgreSQL are excellent choices.
2. **Install your chosen DBMS**:
   - SQLite: Download from [sqlite.org](https://sqlite.org)
   - MySQL: Download from [mysql.com](https://mysql.com)
   - PostgreSQL: Download from [postgresql.org](https://postgresql.org)
3. **Set up your development environment**:
   - Install a SQL client or IDE for easier interaction with your database. Some popular options include:
     - MySQL Workbench (for MySQL)
     - pgAdmin (for PostgreSQL)
     - DBeaver (supports multiple databases)
     - DataGrip (supports multiple databases)
4. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aviral-bhardwaj/LeetCodeSQLByAviralBhardwaj.git
5. **Create a test database**:
   - Use the scripts provided in the **Scripts/** directory to set up a test database with sample data.
6. **Verify your setup**:
   - Try running a simple query from one of the problem solutions to ensure everything is working correctly.

## Tips for Solving SQL Problems

1. Understand the problem: Carefully read the problem statement and examine the sample input and output.
2. Analyze the data structure: Look at the table schemas and relationships between tables.
3. Start simple: Begin with a basic query and gradually add complexity.
4. Use appropriate JOINs: Choose the right type of JOIN based on the relationship between tables.
5. Leverage subqueries: Use subqueries to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.
6. Optimize your queries: Consider performance by using appropriate indexes and avoiding unnecessary operations.
7. Test edge cases: Consider null values, empty sets, and boundary conditions.
8. Learn from others: Study multiple solutions to the same problem to learn different approaches.
9. Practice regularly: Consistency is key to improving your SQL skills.
10. Understand the DBMS: Be aware of syntax differences between different database systems.
