Installation and Setup
To use this repository effectively, you'll need to set up a SQL environment on your local machine. Here's a step-by-step guide to get you started:
Choose a Database Management System (DBMS):
For beginners, SQLite is a lightweight option that doesn't require a separate server process.
For more advanced users, MySQL or PostgreSQL are excellent choices.
Install your chosen DBMS:
SQLite: Download from sqlite.org
MySQL: Download from mysql.com
PostgreSQL: Download from postgresql.org
Set up your development environment:
Install a SQL client or IDE for easier interaction with your database. Some popular options include:
MySQL Workbench (for MySQL)
pgAdmin (for PostgreSQL)
DBeaver (supports multiple databases)
DataGrip (supports multiple databases)
Clone the repository:
Open your terminal and run the following command:
bash
git clone https://github.com/aviral-bhardwaj/LeetCodeSQLByAviralBhardwaj.git
Create a test database:
Use the scripts provided in the Scripts/ directory to set up a test database with sample data.
Verify your setup:
Try running a simple query from one of the problem solutions to ensure everything is working correctly.

Each problem in this repository is tagged with relevant categories to help you focus on specific areas of SQL.
Tips for Solving SQL Problems
Understand the problem: Carefully read the problem statement and examine the sample input and output.
Analyze the data structure: Look at the table schemas and relationships between tables.
Start simple: Begin with a basic query and gradually add complexity.
Use appropriate JOINs: Choose the right type of JOIN based on the relationship between tables.
Leverage subqueries: Use subqueries to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.
Optimize your queries: Consider performance by using appropriate indexes and avoiding unnecessary operations.
Test edge cases: Consider null values, empty sets, and boundary conditions.
Learn from others: Study multiple solutions to the same problem to learn different approaches.
Practice regularly: Consistency is key to improving your SQL skills.
Understand the DBMS: Be aware of syntax differences between different database systems.
